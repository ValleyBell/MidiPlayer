This folder contains instrument list files.
Most of them were copied from MIDI Sequencer Cherry version 1.4.3 and thus use its format.

I fixed a few mistakes in some of them.

gs.ins:
- I fixed a few instruments that were incorrectly assigned to the wrong Sound Canvas model.
- MT-32/CM-64 instruments are NOT available on a non-Pro SC-88 in the SC-88 map. (Only in the SC-55 map.)
  SC-88Pro and later have them available in all instrument maps.
- Spelling of SC-55 instrument names was fixed based on the SC-55 mkII ROM.
  Originally SC-88Pro names were used, which were sometimes slightly shortened.
- Spelilng of SC-88 and SC-88Pro instrument names was fixed+verified based on the results of a "dump instrument names" SysEx command sent an SC-88VL and an SC-88Pro.

xg.ins:
- I fixed a few SFX voices that were incorrectly assigned to MU80 instead of XG.
