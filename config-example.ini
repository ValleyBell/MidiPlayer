; When multiple MIDI ports match and the alias name has no #, the first match will be assigned. Else all matching ports will
; be assigned and # will be replaced with an increasing number (starting at 0).

; Module Names: (valid for ModType and PlayTypes)
;   General MIDI:
;       GM, GM_L2
;   Roland GS:
;       SC-55, SC-88, SC-88Pro, SC-8850, SC-xx (all SC types)
;   Yamaha XG:
;       MU50, MU80, MU90, MU100, MU128, MU1000, MUxx (all MU types)
;   Korg X5 series:
;       K-GMb, 05R/W, X5DR, NS5R
;   Other:
;       TG300B (Yamaha GS), MT-32
; Alternatively use 0xNN for a specific module type via ID.
;   0x1# = SC-xx, 0x2# = MUxx

; Note: When playing an MT-32 file on a GS-compatible module (SC-xx and TG300B),
;       the MT-32 and CM-32P instruments will be enforced for best possible playback.

; [Module] - a name defined in General/Modules entry
; ModType = type of the module
;   Note: Make sure this is set correctly as it enables device-specific hacks and workarounds!
; PlayTypes = list of types that the module is able to play
; Ports = list of ports to be used for the module
;   A port can be either a number (OS-specific MIDI output device ID) or an alias name defined in the "Devices" section.
; PortDelay = list of times (milliseconds) how much the events have to delayed on the respective port
;   This can be used to synchronize software MIDI emulation (e.g. Munt) with hardware MIDI devices.
; ChnMask = mask of channels to be sent to the respective port
;   This allows you to split channels of a single MIDI-file-port across multiple devices.
;   A single mask can be specified as:
;       - hexadecimal bitmask, e.g. 0x12AB
;       - a single decimal channel number (1-based), e.g. 10
;       - a channel range consisting of 2 decimal 1-based channel numbers, e.g. 1-10 or 11-16
;   Note: In order to use 2-port MIDIs with channel split, you need to define twice as many ports as listed in ChnMask.
; SimpleVolCtrl = simple volume control
;   Set to True if the device supports only Main Volume control changes and Note Velocity.
;   Expression and Master Volume adjustments will then be applied to the channel volume.
;   Required for certain older devices like Roland U-110 and OPL3 FM drivers.
; AoTInsChange = ahead-of-time instrument changes
;   Set to True to make instrument changes being sent prematurely, up to 50 ms before the next NoteOn.
;   This improves playback on certain old MIDI modules (e.g. Roland U-110) that lag when loading new patches.
